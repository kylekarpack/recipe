- Bugfix: Riot.ini is in the Riot folder with write permissions, but Riot
creates and uses Application Data folder. Fixed !
- The Save button is now context sensitive - meaning it is automatically disabled and enabled when needed (ex: disabled after
Save to see the operation completed succesfully, disabled if the autoamtic preview is not active, etc)
- added option to show the "Save As" Dialog on the "Save" action. Default false, requests only replace confirmation if file exists or
shows the dialog if the file does not exist.
- the last used save folder is now stored and used each time the user presses "Save as"

- added new hidden configuration variable for use within Riot.ini: UseLatestCommonDialogs (0 disabled [default], 1 enabled).
When enabled Riot shows the new Vista dialogs. When disabled the old XP style dialogs are shown in Vista.
Note that the IrfanView plugin gives access violations when using the new dialogs.
- DLL version: fixed black background for icons in some rare cases (no manifest in calling app)
- other minor improvements

v.0.3.3 - 13 may 2009
- plugins: fixed some memory leaks (especially noticeable in batch operations with RIOT_SaveToFile/RIOT_SaveToFile_U).
Set file size function from IrfanView was affected by this problem.
- in the previous version of FreeImage bundled with RIOT v0.3.2 the support for different TIFF compression types was ommited. Now fixed.
- fixed some invalid pointer operations

- bugfix: rotating 4bit images now works
- cbanged the general font to an antialiased one (Trebuchet MS)
- minor corrections for display on 120 dpi font setting
- The ini file was not read at startup in some functions and that made the program ask for resample each time.
Function affected from the plugin version were: RIOT_LoadFromFile/RIOT_LoadFromHBITMAP.
In the standalone version opening images using the command line or dropping files onto the program icon in explorer. 
- bugfix: File->Exit or pressing Esc terminates the application but does not save settings. Fixed !
- bugfix: after modifying Show Captions for main toolbar buttons the image is now centered.
- plugins: if file sent as parameter does not exist or left blank Original File Info is not updated (occurs in rare situations)

v.0.3.2
- plugin: fixed a problem in 0.3.1 with the IrfanView plugin when retrieving configuration settings. An access violation error was thrown.
- configuration data is now stored in the current user's Application Data folder.
If Riot.ini is found in the Riot folder, it is used only if the current user has write permissions for it.
(this makes it compatible with putting Rot in Program Files for Vista)
 
v.0.3.1
- 4bpp output now supported (automatically chosen when quantizating to less than 16 colors)
- keep transparency for 1 and 4 bit PNG
- added Save button for quick saving over the original. Save as is still there for choosing another folder

To operate in IrfanView it needs a new version of IrfanView (next after 4.23)
- upgraded libpng to 1.2.35
- some optimizations in FreeImage (from the official CVS)
- plugins only: fixed some object destruction bugs causing unexpected behaviour (usually access violations).
This bug especially affects Compress to size.
- plugins: improvements in file info display from the title bar
(don't display size twice when DIB size equals original image size from file).
- plugins: for unsupported images file info was not updated. In this situation it shows BMP as format

v.0.3.0 (beta) 
- new/usability: interesting interface changes including new layout, new icons 
- new/usability: automatically store last used settings on exit in ini file 
- new/usability: check for updates automatically every month on program startup or manually

- improvement/usability: separate tab for the new transparency options (keep, blend/composite, set opaque).
The program now properly handles alpha transparency composition to 24bit 
- new/usability: options dialog 
- plugins: allows user to import ancillary data (transparency, background color, metadata, ICC profile, image resolution)
from original filename when the image is sent as DIB. The ability to import transparency from original file is offered for
IrfanView which does not send 32bit DIBs. Transparency is imported only when DIB and original file have the same size. 
- new/usability: auto-rotate images according to EXIF info 
- new/usability: option to show/hide button captions from the main toolbar 
- new/usability: the user can choose the zoom step percent
