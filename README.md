Revercipe

======

This repository contains the files for creating a reverse recipe search and food management application.

The main components are:

1. A Python scraper for creating a database
2. A login system (very simple at this point, very low security)
3. A PHP API for interacting with the database
4. A front-end dashboard for the user
